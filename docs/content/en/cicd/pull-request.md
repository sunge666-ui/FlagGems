# Pull Request Checks

All workflows below live under `.github/workflows/`. Unless noted otherwise,
they target pull requests against the `master` branch.

## 1. `triage.yaml` — PR labeling

**Trigger:** `pull_request_target` on `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`,
`ready_for_review`.

`pull_request_target` runs in the context of the base repository, so it has
write access to labels even for PRs from forks. It:

- Applies path-based labels using `actions/labeler` and `.github/labeler.yml`
  (e.g. `vendor/NVIDIA`, `tests`, `ops/cpp`, `documentation`, `examples`,
  `ops/alpha` — the label set that other workflows key off of).
- Applies a size label (`size/XSmall` … `size/XLarge`) based on diff size.
- Adds a `competition` or `KernelGen` label when the PR title matches those
  programs.

`unittest.yaml` waits for `triage.yaml` to finish before reading labels, so
labels are always in place before label-gated jobs decide whether to run.

## 2. `rule-check.yaml` — static rule checks

**Trigger:** `pull_request` on `opened`, `reopened`, `synchronize`.

Runs a set of lightweight Python scripts (under `tools/ci_checks/`) against
the operators changed in the PR, derived by diffing `conf/operators.yaml`
and related source files between the PR base and head:

| Job | Enforces |
|---|---|
| `derive-changed-operators` | Computes the operator/file diff used by all jobs below |
| `check-operators-yaml` | New/changed operators are registered correctly in `conf/operators.yaml` |
| `check-init-exports` | Operators exported in `__init__.py` are registered and vice versa |
| `check-kernelgen-tests` | Test files don't call `use_gems()` (bypasses reference comparison) |
| `check-operator-markers` | Each operator has a test file and a matching `@pytest.mark.<id>` |
| `check-aten-operators` | `for:` entries in `operators.yaml` match valid ATen operator names |
| `check-api-logs` | *(warning-only, always exits 0)* operators follow the API logging convention |
| `check-benchmark-coverage` | *(warning-only, always exits 0)* changed operators have a benchmark file |

Most jobs are gated with `if: needs.derive-changed-operators.outputs.has_changes
== 'true'` and are **skipped** for PRs that don't touch operator-related
files (e.g. a docs-only or CI-only PR).

A `rule-check-required` job aggregates the results of all jobs above and
always runs (`if: always()`), treating skipped upstream jobs as passing.
Branch protection should require this aggregate job rather than the
individual jobs — requiring a job that gets skipped on some PRs leaves the
check permanently pending and blocks merges.

`ci-report-feishu.yaml` listens for `rule-check` completion (`workflow_run`)
and posts a summary to a Feishu Bitable, including for PRs from forks (since
`workflow_run` also executes in the base repo context with access to
secrets).

## 3. `linter.yml` — code style

**Trigger:** `pull_request` on `opened`, `edited`, `reopened`, `synchronize`;
also `push` to `master`.

Runs `pre-commit` (the same hooks contributors run locally via
`pre-commit install`) to check Python formatting and basic style rules.

## 4. `unittest.yaml` — operator and backend tests

**Trigger:** `pull_request` on `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`,
`labeled`, `unlabeled`; also `push` to `master` and manual
`workflow_dispatch`.

This is the main test entrypoint. A `preprocess` job first waits for
`triage.yaml`, then computes the PR's changed files, PR number, current
labels, and a per-backend test matrix (from `.github/backends.json`,
filtered to backends whose `vendor/*` label is present on the PR). All
other jobs are **label-gated** — a job only runs if the PR carries the
matching label:

| Job | Runs when label is present | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `build-doc` | `documentation` (and PR merged) | Syncs docs via `sync-docs.yaml` |
| `cpp-op` | `ops/cpp` | Builds and runs the C++ extension test suite (`cpp-op-test.yaml`) |
| `python-op` | `tests` | Runs `tools/test-op.sh` on the changed operators (NVIDIA runner) |
| `examples` | `examples` | Runs `tools/test-examples.sh` (end-to-end model tests) |
| `backend-tests` | any `vendor/*` label | Runs `backend-test.yaml` once per matched backend/runner |
| `alpha-ops` | `ops/alpha` | Runs the experimental-ops test script on NVIDIA |

`backend-test.yaml` (a reusable `workflow_call` workflow) checks out the PR,
runs the vendor's GPU-availability check, sets up the environment via the
`setup-flaggems` composite action, then runs `tools/test-op.sh` (or an
alternate `test_script` for `alpha-ops`) scoped to the PR's changed files.

Five vendors (Hygon, MetaX, MooreThreads, Iluvatar, Kunlunxin) only have their
driver/runtime available inside a vendor container, so those jobs run inside
that container. The container image, `docker run` options, volume mounts, and
runner labels all come from the `container` block of each backend's entry in
`.github/backends.json`: `unittest.yaml` reads them into the test matrix and
passes them through to `backend-test.yaml` as `workflow_call` inputs. This
keeps the container configuration in a single source of truth
(`.github/backends.json`) shared with the on-demand `command.yaml` workflow
below.

Because these jobs are skipped when the corresponding label is absent, a
`unittest-required` gate job aggregates `preprocess`, `cpp-op`, `python-op`,
`examples`, `backend-tests`, and `alpha-ops` with `if: always()`, so branch
protection can require a single, always-present check instead of the
individual label-gated jobs.

## 5. On-demand and comment-triggered workflows

These respond to `issue_comment` events on a PR, so anyone with write access
can trigger them by commenting:

- **`command.yaml`** (`/test <operator>:<runner>`) — checks out the PR
  (including forks, via `github/command` with `allow_forks: true`), runs the
  named operator's tests on the named runner, and posts the result (and a
  before/after comparison for existing operators) as a PR comment.
- **`fix-sort.yaml`** (`/fix-sort`) — runs `tools/ci_checks/sort_exports.py
  --fix` from the trusted `master` copy against the PR branch, commits and
  pushes the fix if anything changed, and comments the outcome.

`command.yaml` has one generic job plus one job per containerized vendor
(Hygon, MetaX, MooreThreads, Iluvatar, Kunlunxin). Because the workflow is
triggered by `issue_comment` rather than `pull_request`, the default checkout
doesn't land on the PR branch, so each job checks it out explicitly via the
`gh pr checkout` in the `checkout-pr` composite action. The per-vendor jobs
resolve their container image, options, and runner labels from the same
`container` block in `.github/backends.json` (looked up in `preprocess`), so
the container configuration is not duplicated between `command.yaml` and
`backend-test.yaml`. The shared step logic lives in composite actions under
`.github/actions/`:

| Composite action | Used for |
|---|---|
| `checkout-pr` | Install the `gh` CLI if missing (picking the binary matching the runner's CPU arch), then `gh pr checkout` the PR branch |
| `setup-flaggems` | Run `setup.sh` for the backend and the GPU-availability check |
| `ondemand-test` | Run the single-operator accuracy/perf comparison, upload the result artifact, and post the PR comment |

## Setting required status checks

When configuring branch protection or a repository ruleset for `master`,
prefer the aggregate/gate jobs over individual sub-jobs wherever a workflow
has conditional (`if:`) or label-gated jobs:

- `rule-check / rule-check-required`
- `unittest / unittest-required`
- `linter / code-style` (not gated, safe to require directly)

Requiring a job that GitHub Actions may legitimately skip for some PRs
leaves that check in a permanent "Expected" state and blocks auto-merge
indefinitely, since GitHub's required-check logic does not treat "skipped"
as equivalent to "passed" for that purpose.
